# GSM-based-localisation-system
This project is an Arduino-based localization system that uses a Neoway GSM module and GPS module to determine the location of a device and send it via SMS using AT commands. The user can call the SIM card associated with the device to receive the location information as an SMS. The project can be customized by modifying the code.
